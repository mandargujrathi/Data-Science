# Data-Science
This report analyses the New York taxi data collected in 2013. It works with two data files which are saved as csv files. 
The columns of the data set contain information such as pick up and drop off times, trip times, total amount, fare amount
tip amounts, medallion, licence no, etc. The report first explores the data by answering some basic questions and later on
dives into addressing some open questions as well. This report is created with MATLAB 2017b.
